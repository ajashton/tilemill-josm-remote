JOSM Remote Control Plugin for TileMill
=======================================

This is a plugin for [TileMill][1] that adds an 'Edit in JOSM' button to your
map preview (if you are zoomed in far enough). It can be helpful in the 
development of an OpenStreetMap-based TileMill project for quickly checking
and fixing issues with OSM data as you come across it.
