JOSM Remote Control Plugin for TileMill
=======================================

This is a plugin for [TileMill][1] that allows you to open a JOSM editing
session based on the current map view (JOSM must already be running).  It adds
a button to the top left corner of the map preview at zoom level 14 and above.

It can be helpful in the development of an OpenStreetMap-based TileMill project
for quickly checking and fixing issues with OSM data as you come across it.
